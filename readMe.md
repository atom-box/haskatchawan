# Coding Challenges in Haskell

## What's going on here:
I am solving very short exercises in Haskell.  Selected screenshots from src1, src2, and src3:<br><br>
src2/Experiment/Rhoda.hs code (Several algorithms in one module)<br>

Rhoda.hs running as a module of Main.hs<br>

## Reflection
In these beginners lessons, "thinking functionally" is just GNU/BASh tools and pipes.  The crazy stuff with Monads, et cetera does not come until Ch. 10 of Lipovaƒça. <br><br>So far, Haskell is not harder than Javascript.  One upside: compared to JS, Haskell is more internally consistant with its own rules. In that respect, Haskell is like 11th grade Physics and Javascript is like 10th grade chemistry. <br><br>Compared to learning Elm language, the Haskell tutorials are less restricted to the DOM and web development so they unleash a lot of beauty.  For example, lists can have infinite length. For example, you can make a one line solution for finding all possible right triangles. For example, recursive programming is suddenly useful.

## Resources
1. The free, full sized book [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) with awesome illustrations
2. Instructions for sandboxed [installation](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/stack-play) using Stacker
3. 	Chris Allen's [Resource List](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell)
4. Hundreds of unannotated [examples](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/Simple%20examples).  Wide-ranging.
