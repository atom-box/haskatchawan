# Coding Challenges in Haskell

## What's going on here:
I am solving short exercises in Haskell.  My most recent snippets are in the [Examples](https://github.com/atom-box/haskatchawan/blob/master/Examples/Oscar.hs) folder.<br><br>
Typical code snippet from [Oscar.hs](https://github.com/atom-box/haskatchawan/tree/master/Examples):<br>

Typical output:<br>

## My Reflections on Studying Haskell.
 "Thinking functionally" in the beginning is an extension of GNU/BASh tools and pipes.  In Haskell, dollar sign ($) is a pipe flowing from right to left and dot (.) is a pipe for just verbs.  <br><br>
Compared to Javascript, Haskell is more internally consistant with its own rules. In that respect, Haskell is like 11th grade Physics and Javascript is like 10th grade chemistry. <br><br>Compared to learning Elm language, the Haskell tutorials are less restricted to the DOM and web development so they unleash a lot of beauty.  For example, recursive programming is suddenly useful.<br><br>
I can read type notation half of the time.  Crucially, I often cannot read it in the compiler error messages.  And can rarely write it.  One trick for writing it is to play around in GHCi and then let GHCi tell me the types, using (:t).


## Resources for Trying Out Haskell (in recommended order)
1. First, I want to say I did this because I had to whiteboard in a functional language but I would do it again just for the pleasure. The resources, the folks, the blogs, the books below, all are a fresh feeling compared to whatever other language you usually use.  And they are sort of aware Haskell is a persistant but not a trending language so they try harder to be friendly. It was fun, like being a child learning to code in Turtle.
2. Before you play around, you will need to install some implementation of Haskell.  One very common way is shown in the instructions for sandboxed [installation](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/stack-play) using Stacker.
3. Orient yourself to the directions you can go next with Chris Allen's [Resource List](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell) 
4. Go from beginner to intermediate with the free, full sized book [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) with awesome illustrations
5. As you code, keep checking the hundreds of unannotated [examples](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/Simple%20examples).  Wide-ranging.
