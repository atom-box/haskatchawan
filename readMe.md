# Coding Challenges in Haskell

## What's going on here:
I am solving very short exercises in Haskell.<br><br>
src2/Experiment/Rhoda.hs code (Several algorithms in one module)<br>

## Reflection
"Thinking functionally" is something you already do on the command line, with GNU/BASh tools and pipes. <br><br>So far, Haskell is not harder than Javascript.  One upside: compared to JS, Haskell is more internally consistant with its own rules. In that respect, Haskell is like 11th grade Physics and Javascript is like 10th grade chemistry. <br><br>Compared to learning Elm language, the Haskell tutorials are less restricted to the DOM and web development so they unleash a lot of beauty.  For example, lists can have infinite length. For example, you can make a one line solution for finding all possible right triangles. For example, recursive programming is suddenly useful.
